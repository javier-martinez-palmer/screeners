	// I am going to attempt to explain what is going on below up here as not to clutter the 
	// code below.  We have a model that has a certain amount of objects and textures.  We want 
	// to go through each object in the model, bind it's texture map to it, then render it.
	// To render the current object, we go through all of it's faces (Polygons).  
	// What is a face you ask?  A face is just (in this case) a triangle of the object.
	// For instance, a cube has 12 faces because each side has 2 triangles.
	// You might be thinking.  Well, if there are 12 faces in a cube, that makes
	// 36 vertices that we needed to read in for that object.  Not really true.  Because
	// a lot of the vertices are the same, since they share sides, they only need to save
	// 8 vertices, and ignore the duplicates.  Then, you have an array of all the
	// unique vertices in that object.  No 2 vertices will be the same.  This cuts down
	// on memory.  Then, another array is saved, which is the index numbers for each face,
	// which index in to that array of vertices.  That might sound silly, but it is better
	// than saving tons of duplicate vertices.  The same thing happens for UV coordinates.
	// You don't save duplicate UV coordinates, you just save the unique ones, then an array
	// that index's into them.  This might be confusing, but most 3D files use this format.
	// This loop below will stay the same for most file formats that you load, so all you need
	// to change is the loading code.  You don't need to change this loop (Except for animation).
